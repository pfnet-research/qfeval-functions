"When performing broadcast between the given tensors, the number of "
"elements may increase and the space complexity may increase, but this "
"function still performs the calculation with the original space "
"complexity.  For instance, when operating on tensors with shapes (N, 1, "
"D) and (1, M, D), the space complexity remains at O(ND + MD) instead of "
"O(NMD)."
