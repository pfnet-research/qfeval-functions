"Specifically, this assigns the weighted mean of valid values with a "
"Gaussian filter to each element.  This makes values outside the range "
"have no weight, so it works well even for biased values, while zero "
"padding brings the surrounding values closer to zero.  Additionally, as "
"it makes NaN values have no weight, it also works well for biased values "
"that include NaNs."

"NOTE: This function uses interval averages of a Gaussian function instead"
" of point-sampling for its discretized window function.  Typical "
"implementations of Gaussian filters use point-sampling (e.g., "
"`scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d`).  However, they have an undersampling "
"issue for small $\\sigma$ (c.f., https://bartwronski.com/2021/10/31/, "
"Implementation section in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur). "
"This calculates the interval averages using the integral of a Gaussian "
"function."
